The Delaney dataset is a collection of 2874 aqueous solubility measurements from this paper:

Delaney, John S. "ESOL: estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure." Journal of chemical information and computer sciences 44.3 (2004): 1000-1005.

In this example, we train a series of different DeepChem models against this task.
